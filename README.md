## üåü Features

- **Automatic MCP Server Detection**: Reads your Claude Desktop configuration to find all configured MCP servers
- **Smart Repository Analysis**: Detects Git repositories even if they're in parent directories
- **Multi-Technology Support**: Handles various project types including Node.js, Python, Go, Java, Rust, .NET, and C/C++
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides comprehensive analysis of all your MCP servers
- **Safe Updates**: Creates backup branches before applying updates
- **Intelligent Build Process**: Automatically runs the correct build commands based on project type
- **Localization Support**: Available in multiple languages (English, French)

## üìã Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Git installed and in your PATH
- Claude Desktop installed
- Package managers for your MCP servers (npm, pip, etc.)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Download the latest release or clone this repository
2. Run `Update-MCP-Servers.ps1` from PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Update-MCP-Servers.ps1
```

3. The script will analyze all your MCP servers and offer to update those that are behind

## üìä What It Does

The tool performs these operations:

1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Reads the Claude Desktop configuration file to identify all MCP servers
   - Detects the location of each server on disk
   - Finds the Git repository associated with each server
   - Determines the project type and required build tools
   - Checks if updates are available from the remote repository

2. **Reporting Phase**:
   - Displays detailed information about each server
   - Shows which servers can be updated
   - Generates a detailed JSON report

3. **Update Phase** (optional):
   - Creates backup branches to preserve your current state
   - Pulls the latest changes from remote repositories
   - Installs dependencies using the appropriate package manager
   - Builds the updated code using the correct build system

## üõ†Ô∏è Supported Project Types

| Type | Detection Method | Update Commands |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Node.js | package.json | npm install, npm run build |
| TypeScript | tsconfig.json | npm install, npm run build |
